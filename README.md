## About
Eat Me is a simple and efficient restaurant management system. Mainly in this project we have
discussed how a restaurant can maximize their revenue by implementing a smart ordering
system, inventory management system, delivery system and customer management system in
one application called Eat Me. Beyond that we have included functions like generating reports
for decision making purposes and some rating systems to make sure that the most respectful
customers and staff members are using Eat Me.
